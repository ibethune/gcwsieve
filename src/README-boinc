These executables were linked against version 6.2.18 of the BOINC libraries.
By default they will query boinc_time_to_checkpoint() every 5 seconds.

The .static-cpp executables were statically linked against the C++ libraries
and so should work on those systems where the C++ libraries have not been
installed.

There are no Windows excutables because I haven't yet found a way to build
the BOINC libraries with the MinGW compilers. Please tell me how to do this
if you know.
